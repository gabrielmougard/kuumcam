; This conf file will gather all the network information when the endpoint
; will attempt a connection to the platform.
;
; At first use, this file remain empty. That's only at the first device connection
; that it would be filled, thus allowing data persistence which will be useful for 
; later connection, since we don't want to synchronize the device each time.

[PINS]
; [INTERNET_PIN]: Blue LED to indicate network health (if we are connected to the Internet or not)
INTERNET_PIN:

[PLATFORM]
; [UUID]: a Universally Unique IDentifier (string), generated by the platform to identify the endpoint among all the others. 
; It'll represent the target route for sending the stream on the platform (we use udp as a streaming protocol) : udp://endpoint.kuumba.com/<UUID>
; [USERNAME]: The username of the associated account.
; [LOCATION]: The location of the device (lat/lng string) (when it's being connected during the synchronization process with the platform)
; the location variable will be refreshed one time everyday at 12 P.M CEST using a cronjob. (API call)
; [FIRST_CONN_ROUTE]: the URL path of our platform to handle requests for the first endpoint connection. In prod, it will be something like
; https://kuumba.com/first-connection/ . For local testing, we can use something like http://localhost:5000/first-connection/  (see the test server (in Flask) in `testServer/` folder)
; [CONN_ROUTE]: the URL path of our platform to handle the connection to the platform using the persisted endpoint UUID. In prod, it will be something like
; https://kuumba.com/connection/  . For local testing, we can use something like http://localhost:5000/connection/ (see the test server (in Flask) in `testServer/` folder)
